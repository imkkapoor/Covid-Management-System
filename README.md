Hey!!!
Welcome to my project!
I created this for my class 12 CBSE board practicals.
So let's get to the project!

What is CMS?

So, CMS is a covid management system which helps us to store,update,view and represent 
data of covid patients and the medical staff involved with the help of a python code
linked with MySQL. 

I hope you like it!
